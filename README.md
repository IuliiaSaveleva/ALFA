# ALFA: Agglomerative Late Fusion Algorithm for Object Detection

By Evgenii Razinkov, Iuliia Saveleva, Jiří Matas

The paper "ALFA: Agglomerative Late Fusion Algorithm for Object Detection" is accepted 
to ICPR 2018, the link and description to the method will be added here as soon as 
the paper become available.

Script ensemble.py contains code for the ALFA algorithm.

There is also Dynamic Belief Fusion algorithm in our implementation, 
as there is no source code available for it, in 
DBF_multiclass.py script.

This is he first test version of repository. The good structure of a project, 
necessary supplementary code and scripts usability will be done in a short time.
